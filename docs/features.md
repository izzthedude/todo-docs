   The User must be able to create, view, edit, and delete a Todo Item.

## **View Todo List**  
   The User must be able to view a Todo List containing all their Todo Items.

## **Search Item**  
   The User must be able to search for an Item based on some input. The List will then
   only display Items that match the input. If no input is given, then all available
   Items are displayed.

   Items is deleted, the Item(s) will be automatically associated with a default "None"
   Category, which cannot be deleted.

   The User must be able to filter Items by the selected Category or Categories.

## **Data Persistence**  
   The User must be able to leave and resume a session without losing any data.
