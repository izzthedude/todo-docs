# Introduction

This is the documentation website for my Todo app. This is where I'll lay out the basic
specifications and design of the app that all implementations will try to adhere to.

## Description

My Todo app is a personal project involving making a Todo app in multiple
implementations, both backend and frontend, and in various levels of complexity. My main
motivation for doing something like this is to learn. Learn what, exactly?

**Quite literally, anything.**

I plan to make and remake this Todo app in multiple languages, using different frameworks
from each, all for the sake of learning how to do stuff in various ways. I find that
learning different kinds of workflows forces me to think in ways I'm not used to, which
results in me having a bigger set of tools under my belt and being able to approach
problems from various perspectives.

### Why a Todo app?

It's a very simple base concept for an app that can be extended endlessly, adding whatever
features I want and making it as complex as I want it to be. This makes it perfect for
experimenting with various technologies and concepts.

## Goals

- To learn different languages
- To learn different frameworks of different languages
- To learn various workflows, technologies and concepts
- To have a 'playground' project that I can experiment with
- **To have fun :)**
